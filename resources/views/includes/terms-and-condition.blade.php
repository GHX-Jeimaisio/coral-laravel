                    <li>The £30 free bet offer is available for new coral.co.uk customers who deposit and bet a total of
                        £30 on any sports event(s).
                    </li>

                        subsequent deposit values.
                    </li>
                    <li>Customers depositing and staking less than £30 will receive the equivalent free bet value. For
                        example: a customer that deposits an initial amount of £5 will be credited with a £5 free bet
                        once they have bet a total of £5 on any sports event(s).

                        can be bet in increments). The free bet must then be staked before any withdrawal is permitted.
